## üéØ About

The Facial Expression Reader is a web-based application that leverages deep learning models to detect and classify human facial expressions in real-time. It uses your device's camera to capture video feed and analyzes facial features to determine emotional states with confidence scores.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Instant emotion recognition with live video feed
- **7 Emotion Categories**: Detects Neutral, Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Disgusted, and Surprised
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Face bounding box overlay
  - Live emotion confidence bars
  - Dominant emotion display with emoji indicators
- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally in your browser
- **No Installation Required**: Run directly in any modern web browser
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful glassmorphism design with smooth animations

## üé¨ Demo

1. Open the HTML file in your browser
2. Click "Start Camera" to activate your webcam
3. Allow camera permissions when prompted
4. Watch as the AI detects and analyzes your facial expressions in real-time
5. See confidence scores for all emotions and the dominant emotion highlighted

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Core Technologies
- **HTML5**: Structure and video capture
- **CSS3**: Styling with gradients, glassmorphism, and animations
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Application logic and real-time processing

### AI/ML Libraries
- **face-api.js** (`@vladmandic/face-api`): Face detection and expression recognition
  - Built on top of TensorFlow.js
  - Pre-trained neural network models
- **TinyFaceDetector**: Lightweight face detection model
- **FaceExpressionNet**: Deep learning model for emotion classification

### CDN Resources
- face-api.js library: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@vladmandic/face-api/dist/face-api.min.js`
- Pre-trained models: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@vladmandic/face-api/model/`

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Webcam access
- Internet connection (for loading libraries and models)

### Installation

1. **Download the HTML file**
   ```bash
   # Clone or download the project
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd facial-expression-reader
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   - Simply double-click the HTML file, or
   - Use a local server for better performance:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Direct: Open `index.html` in your browser
   - Local server: Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### No Build Process Required
This is a standalone HTML application - no npm, webpack, or build tools needed!

## üß† How It Works

### 1. Model Loading
The application loads two pre-trained neural network models:
- **TinyFaceDetector**: Detects faces in the video frame
- **FaceExpressionNet**: Analyzes facial features to classify emotions

### 2. Video Capture
Uses the browser's `getUserMedia` API to access the webcam and stream video.

### 3. Real-Time Processing
- Captures frames from video stream
- Detects face locations using TinyFaceDetector
- Extracts facial landmarks and features
- Runs expression classification on detected faces
- Returns confidence scores for each emotion

### 4. Visualization
- Draws bounding boxes around detected faces
- Updates emotion bars with confidence percentages
- Highlights the dominant emotion with emoji and confidence score

## üòä Detected Emotions

The application recognizes 7 fundamental human emotions:

| Emotion | Emoji | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Neutral | üòê | Calm, expressionless face |
| Happy | üòä | Smiling, joyful expression |
| Sad | üò¢ | Downcast, unhappy expression |
| Angry | üò† | Frowning, hostile expression |
| Fearful | üò® | Anxious, scared expression |
| Disgusted | ü§¢ | Repulsed, distasteful expression |
| Surprised | üò≤ | Shocked, astonished expression |

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Start the Application**
   - Open the HTML file in your browser
   - Wait for "AI models loaded!" message

2. **Activate Camera**
   - Click the "Start Camera" button
   - Grant camera permissions when prompted

3. **View Results**
   - Position your face in front of the camera
   - Observe real-time emotion detection
   - Check confidence scores for all emotions
   - See the dominant emotion highlighted

4. **Stop Detection**
   - Click the "Stop Camera" button when finished

### Tips for Best Results

- **Good Lighting**: Ensure your face is well-lit
- **Face the Camera**: Look directly at the camera
- **Stay in Frame**: Keep your entire face visible
- **Stable Position**: Minimize movement for better accuracy
- **Clear Background**: Avoid cluttered backgrounds
- **Single Face**: Works best with one face at a time

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "Error loading models"
**Problem**: Models failed to load from CDN

**Solutions**:
- Check your internet connection
- Refresh the page
- Clear browser cache
- Try a different browser
- Check if CDN is accessible in your region

#### 2. "Error accessing camera"
**Problem**: Cannot access webcam

**Solutions**:
- Grant camera permissions in browser settings
- Ensure no other application is using the camera
- Check if camera is properly connected
- Try using HTTPS (required by some browsers)
- Restart your browser

#### 3. "faceapi is not defined"
**Problem**: Library not loaded before initialization

**Solutions**:
- This should be fixed in the latest version
- Wait for the page to fully load before clicking buttons
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure internet connection is stable

#### 4. Low FPS or Laggy Performance
**Problem**: Slow detection speed

**Solutions**:
- Close other browser tabs
- Use a more powerful device
- Reduce video resolution
- Ensure good lighting for faster detection
- Close resource-intensive applications

#### 5. Inaccurate Emotion Detection
**Problem**: Wrong emotions detected

**Solutions**:
- Improve lighting conditions
- Face the camera directly
- Make clearer facial expressions
- Remove glasses or face coverings if possible
- Stay within camera frame

## üîê Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All computation happens in your browser
- **No Data Storage**: No images or data are saved
- **No Server Communication**: Video never leaves your device
- **Camera Control**: You have full control over camera access
- **Open Source**: Code is transparent and auditable

## üé® Customization

### Modify Emotions
Edit the `emotionEmojis` object to change emoji representations:
```javascript
const emotionEmojis = {
    neutral: 'üòê',
    happy: 'üòä',
    // Add or modify emotions
};
```

### Adjust Detection Sensitivity
Modify TinyFaceDetector options:
```javascript
new faceapi.TinyFaceDetectorOptions({
    inputSize: 416,  // Increase for better accuracy
    scoreThreshold: 0.5  // Adjust confidence threshold
})
```

### Change Theme Colors
Update CSS gradient values:
```css
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
```
